# dsa-concepts

This repository contains my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems.

## File Naming and Priority

In each problem folder (such as Sliding-Window), files are named with a number prefix (e.g., `01-...`, `02-...`) to indicate the recommended order of solving, starting from the easiest (1) to the hardest. This helps you follow a progressive learning path and tackle problems in increasing order of difficulty.

Feel free to follow the numbered order for practice, or jump to any problem as needed. Each file contains a problem statement, example, and solution.

I will be solving and adding DSA problems here, including code, explanations, and approaches for learning and practice.
