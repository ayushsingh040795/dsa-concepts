/* 
Subarrays with Product Less Than K
Problem Statement
    Given an array of positive integers and an integer K, return the number of contiguous subarrays whose product is strictly less than K.
Example
    Input:
        [10, 5, 2, 6], K = 100
    Output:
        8
Explanation
    Valid subarrays include single elements and multi-element subarrays whose product is less than 100.
    All such qualifying subarrays together total 8.
