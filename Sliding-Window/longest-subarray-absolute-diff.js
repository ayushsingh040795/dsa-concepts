/* Longest Continuous Subarray with Absolute Difference ≤ Limit
Problem Statement

Given an integer array and an integer limit, find the length of the longest contiguous subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray is less than or equal to limit.

Example

Input:
[8, 2, 4, 7], limit = 4

Output:
2

Explanation

The longest valid subarrays are [8, 2] and [2, 4].
Any longer subarray violates the absolute difference constraint. */
